- **CRITICAL**: In agent chat mode, NEVER make changes without the human reviewing the work and making changes
- **MANDATORY WORKFLOW**: Always follow this exact sequence:
  1. INVESTIGATE first - understand the problem completely
  2. VALIDATE the issue - confirm what's wrong with evidence.
  3. ASK FOR CONFIRMATION - get explicit approval before any changes
  4. IMPLEMENT ONE MICRO STEP - make only one small change at a time
  5. STOP AND VALIDATE - confirm each step works before proceeding
- **NEVER**: Jump to implementation, make multiple changes, or assume what needs to be done
- **ALWAYS**: Ask "Should I [specific action]?" before making any changes
- **STRICT ENFORCEMENT**: If I violate this workflow, call me out immediately
- **CONTEXT7 REQUIREMENT**: When validating issues and not 95% sure about patterns, ALWAYS use Context7 MCP to get latest documentation before proposing solutions
- minimize the amount of tokens used and write simple clean svelte 5 patterns with clear variables
- never git commit but do remind the user to do this after a succesfull step is implemented.
- never test or run tests, always ask the human to do this. When the human requests you to test, you can.
