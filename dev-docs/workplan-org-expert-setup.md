# Workplan: Organization-Expert Setup with Multi-Platform Workflow

## üìã Project Overview

This workplan outlines the implementation of a sophisticated expert management system that spans multiple platforms (PDC, SPP, Academy) with complex approval workflows and status tracking.

## üéØ Core Concepts

### **Platforms Involved**
1. **PDC (Platform for Data Collection)** - User master data
2. **SPP (Solution Provider Platform)** - Expert assignments and workflow management
3. **Academy** - Training and certification platform

### **Key Entities**
- **Organizations** - Solution Provider organizations
- **Users** - All users managed in PDC (simulated in our DB)
- **Staff Members** - Users with SPP platform access
- **Experts** - Users who can be assigned to organizations (linked via assignments)
- **Services** - Available services with versioning
- **Service Versions** - Specific versions of services with different rules
- **Organization Service Approvals** - SPP approval for specific service versions
- **Expert Assignments** - Links experts to organizations with service versions
- **Workflow States** - Draft ‚Üí Submitted ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Certified ‚Üí Active

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema Design

## üîÑ Service Versioning & Approval Workflow

### **Service Version Lifecycle**

```
Service Created ‚Üí Version 1.0 Released ‚Üí Organizations Apply ‚Üí Approval Process
     ‚Üì                    ‚Üì                      ‚Üì              ‚Üì
New Rules Added ‚Üí Version 2.0 Released ‚Üí Re-approval Required ‚Üí New Training
```

### **Service Version Rules**

1. **Service Evolution** - Services get new versions with updated rules
2. **Organization Approval** - SPPs must be approved for each service version
3. **Expert Re-qualification** - Experts may need new training for new versions
4. **CV Updates** - New versions may require updated CVs/credentials
5. **Training Requirements** - Most experts need Academy training for new versions

### **Service Version Workflow**

1. **ZDHC creates new service version** (e.g., ETP Assessment 2.0)
2. **SPP organizations apply** for approval for the new version
3. **ZDHC reviews and approves** SPP organizations
4. **SPP can now assign experts** to the new service version
5. **Experts go through workflow** (CV check ‚Üí Training ‚Üí Certification)
6. **Experts become active** for the new service version

### **Version-Specific Expert Assignment**

- **Same expert, different version** = New assignment required
- **Previous certifications** may not apply to new versions
- **Training requirements** may be different per version
- **CV updates** may be required for new versions

## üîÑ Workflow States & Transitions
