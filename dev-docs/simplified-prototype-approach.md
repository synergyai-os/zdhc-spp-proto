# Simplified Prototype Approach - Iterative Development

## 🎯 **Core Principle: Start Simple, Build Incrementally**

Instead of building everything at once, let's break this down into **small, manageable iterations** that each deliver value.

## 🚀 **Phase 1: Minimal Viable Prototype (Week 1)**

### **Goal**: Basic expert management with persistence

### **What to Build**:
1. **Simple User Table** - Just basic user data
2. **Simple Organization Table** - Just organization names
3. **Simple Expert Assignment** - Link users to organizations
4. **Basic UI** - Add expert, view experts, simple status

### **Database Schema (Minimal)**:
```typescript
// Users (simulating PDC)
interface User {
  _id: Id<"users">;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  country: string;
}

// Organizations
interface Organization {
  _id: Id<"organizations">;
  name: string;
}

// Expert Assignments (simplified)
interface ExpertAssignment {
  _id: Id<"expert_assignments">;
  userId: Id<"users">;
  organizationId: Id<"organizations">;
  services: string[]; // Just service names for now
  status: "draft" | "active" | "inactive";
  createdAt: number;
}
```

### **Features**:
- ✅ Add expert to organization
- ✅ View experts by organization
- ✅ Simple status management
- ✅ Basic persistence with Convex

## 🔄 **Phase 2: Service Management (Week 2)**

### **Goal**: Add service versioning

### **What to Add**:
1. **Services Table** - Available services
2. **Service Versions** - Different versions of services
3. **Organization Service Approvals** - Which services orgs can use

### **New Tables**:
```typescript
interface Service {
  _id: Id<"services">;
  name: string;
  currentVersion: string;
}

interface ServiceVersion {
  _id: Id<"service_versions">;
  serviceId: Id<"services">;
  version: string;
  isActive: boolean;
}

interface OrganizationServiceApproval {
  _id: Id<"organization_service_approvals">;
  organizationId: Id<"organizations">;
  serviceVersionId: Id<"service_versions">;
  status: "approved" | "pending";
}
```

### **Features**:
- ✅ Service version selection
- ✅ Organization service approvals
- ✅ Filter experts by service version

---

## 🎭 **Phase 3: User Roles (Week 3)**

### **Goal**: Add staff members and access control

### **What to Add**:
1. **Staff Members Table** - Users with SPP access
2. **Simple Authentication** - Mock login system
3. **Role-based Access** - Different permissions

### **New Tables**:
```typescript
interface StaffMember {
  _id: Id<"staff_members">;
  userId: Id<"users">;
  organizationId: Id<"organizations">;
  role: "admin" | "viewer";
}
```

### **Features**:
- ✅ Mock login system
- ✅ Organization context switching
- ✅ Role-based permissions

---

## 🔄 **Phase 4: Workflow States (Week 4)**

### **Goal**: Add proper workflow management

### **What to Add**:
1. **Extended Status** - More workflow states
2. **Status History** - Track changes
3. **Workflow UI** - Visual progress tracking

### **Features**:
- ✅ Draft → Submitted → Active workflow
- ✅ Status history tracking
- ✅ Visual workflow progress

---

## 🎯 **Recommended Starting Point: Phase 1 Only**

### **Why Start Here**:
1. **Delivers value quickly** - Working expert management in 1 week
2. **Simple to understand** - Easy to explain and demo
3. **Builds confidence** - Success before complexity
4. **Easy to extend** - Foundation for future phases

### **What You Get**:
- ✅ Add experts to organizations
- ✅ View experts by organization
- ✅ Basic status management
- ✅ Persistent data with Convex
- ✅ Working prototype to demo

### **What You Skip (For Now)**:
- ❌ Complex workflow states
- ❌ Service versioning
- ❌ User roles and permissions
- ❌ Multi-platform integration
- ❌ Advanced features

## 🛠️ **Implementation Strategy**

### **Week 1: Phase 1 Implementation**
1. **Day 1-2**: Convex setup + basic schema
2. **Day 3-4**: Simple expert assignment UI
3. **Day 5**: Testing and polish

### **Decision Points**:
- **After Phase 1**: Do you want Phase 2, or is Phase 1 sufficient?
- **After Phase 2**: Do you need Phase 3, or can you demo with Phase 2?
- **Iterative approach**: Build only what you need, when you need it

---

## 💡 **Key Benefits of This Approach**

1. **Quick wins** - Working prototype in 1 week
2. **Manageable complexity** - Each phase is simple
3. **Flexible scope** - Stop when you have enough
4. **Easy to demo** - Each phase delivers value
5. **Low risk** - Small, testable increments

---

## 🎯 **My Recommendation**

**Start with Phase 1 only.** Get a working expert management system with:
- Add experts to organizations
- View experts by organization  
- Basic status management
- Persistent data

**Then decide**: Do you need Phase 2 (service versioning) or is Phase 1 sufficient for your prototype needs?

**This approach gives you a working system quickly while keeping the door open for future enhancements.**

**Would you like me to start implementing Phase 1? It's much simpler and will give you a working prototype in a few days!** 🚀
