# Business Rules - ZDHC Solution Provider Platform (SPP)

## üìã Document Purpose

This document contains **ALL business rules** implemented in the ZDHC Solution Provider Platform. These rules govern data ownership, user workflows, legal compliance, and system behavior. Use this as the **definitive reference** for all development decisions.

---

## üè¢ Platform Overview

### Core Concept
The SPP manages **Solution Provider organizations** and their **expert teams** who provide services to ZDHC members. Organizations must become **ZDHC Approved Solution Providers** to offer services.

### Key Entities
- **ZDHC Staff**: Internal platform administrators and managers
- **Solution Providers**: External organizations providing specific services
- **Experts**: Individual professionals who provide services (can work for multiple organizations)
- **Service Versions**: Specific expertise areas with versioning (ETP Assessment V1, Supplier Assessment V2, etc.)
- **Staff Members**: Users with SPP platform access (admin/manager/viewer roles)

## üè¢ Organization Management Rules

### Rule 1: Multi-Organization Support
**Statement**: Users can work as different organizations with complete data isolation
**Implementation**:

- Data persistence across browser sessions using localStorage
- Clear visual indication of current organization context

### Rule 2: Organization Context Switching
**Statement**: Users must select an organization before accessing expert data
**Implementation**:
- Header displays current organization name and user role

- Status indicators show organization type (SPP/ZDHC) and status (active/inactive/suspended)

### Rule 3: Data Isolation
**Statement**: Each organization can only see and manage their own expert data
**Implementation**:
- Expert queries automatically filter by selected organization
- No cross-organization data visibility
